# Index Sample Dashboards
*The files contained in this repo demonstrate Index's work building custom dashboards. Below is a brief description of each:*

## MicroStrategy Open Payments Dashboard
For the Open Payments Dashboard we wanted to see if there is a correlation between the payments that pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers make to physicians, and physicians' prescribing patterns among Medicare Prescription Drug Program enrollees. We integrated Open Payment and Part D Prescriber data from CMS, as well as Census data for demographic information, to answer the question and explore the patterns around it.

## Qlik National Drug Use Survey Dashboard
For the National Drug Use Survey dashboard, we wanted to gain insight into publicly available Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration data that we populated into a Salesforce database, but at the time, Salesforce dashboard functionality was limited. So, we used Qlik to develop a far more robust dashboard to gain deep insight into modern drug experimentation across different populations in the United States.

## MicroStrategy FAERS Dashboard
For the FAERS dashboard, we used FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data to demonstrate the integration of HTML pages with MicroStrategy reports. For a user who is considering the safety of a specific drug, the adverse events of other drugs in the same therapeutic classification can provide a helpful comparison. Indexâ€™s FAERS application queries the drug data and provides two other drugs that match the Therapeutic classification of the selected drug. The user can then compare the selected drug to the comparison drugs.
